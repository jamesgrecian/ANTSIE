## Observations

Data on the location of observed species of interest are taken from published studies on myctophids, krill, salps and cephalopods and combined using the [Process species presence data.R](scripts/Process species presence data.R) script.

Random background points are generated using the `buffered_points.R` [function](R/buffered_points.R) and combined using [combine presences and absences.R](scripts/combine presences and absences.R)

Contemporary environmental covariates were processed using [Process contemporary covariates.R](R/Process contemporary covariates.R) and then matched to observation locations using [Append covariates to presence absence data.R](Append covariates to presence absence data.R)
